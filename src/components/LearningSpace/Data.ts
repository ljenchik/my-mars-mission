        title: `Moons of Mars`,
        information : `Mars has two small moons: Phobos and Deimos. 
                Phobos (fear) and Deimos (panic) were named after the horses 
                that pulled the chariot of the Greek war god Ares, 
                the counterpart to the Roman war god Mars. 
                Both Phobos and Deimos were discovered in 1877 
                by American astronomer Asaph Hall. The moons appear to have 
                surface materials similar to many asteroids in the outer asteroid belt, 
                which leads most scientists to believe 
                that Phobos and Deimos are captured asteroids`,
