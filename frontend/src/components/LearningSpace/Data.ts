//                 Phobos (fear) and Deimos (panic) were named after the horses 
//                 that pulled the chariot of the Greek war god Ares, 
//                 the counterpart to the Roman war god Mars. 
//                 Both Phobos and Deimos were discovered in 1877 
//                 by American astronomer Asaph Hall. The moons appear to have 
//                 surface materials similar to many asteroids in the outer asteroid belt, 
//                 which leads most scientists to believe

//         however, and the atmospheric pressure at 
//         the surface of Mars is only about 0.6 percent of Earth’s.
//         Scientists think that Mars may have had a thicker atmosphere early in its history,
//          and data from NASA spacecraft indicate that Mars has lost significant amounts of its atmosphere through time. 
//          The primary culprit for Mars’ atmospheric loss is the solar wind!`,
